# Sociality Front-end Internship Challenge

* I have used plain Html,Css and Jquery for this challenge. The website is fully responsive. There is no any back-end job. It's just only front-end.

* I have used reset.css to reset the all browser settings, I give attributes with my hand.

* I try to use css flexbox and em instead of pixel to making responsive website. I seperate the page 2 side with section tags. I gave important to use logic title tags. There is just one h1 in page.
